### ProjectOverview
The primary goal of this project is to build predictive models for estimating body fat percentage and evaluate the performance of various regression techniques. This helps in identifying the most effective model for body fat prediction based on features like age, weight, height, and various body measurements.

### Dataset
Dataset
The dataset includes metrics such as:
CPU utilization
Network packets in/out
Network in/out
CPU credit utilization
AWS CloudWatch balances
The dataset is used to establish thresholds for normal behavior, allowing for the detection of anomalies based on deviations from these benchmarks.

### Features of MAPE-K
Monitor: Continuously track system parameters and performance metrics.
Analyze: Use machine learning models (ARIMA and Isolation Forest) to identify anomalies in the data.
Plan: Develop strategies to address detected anomalies and optimize performance.
Execute: Implement the planned actions to rectify issues or enhance system performance.
Knowledge: Utilize insights gained from previous cycles to improve future monitoring and response strategies.

### Conclusion
- The study emphasizes the importance of both predictive and reactive strategies in auto-scaling anomaly detection.
- The MAPE-K loop facilitates a proactive approach to identifying and resolving anomalies, enhancing system resilience and efficiency.
- Future work may involve experimenting with additional machine learning models and forecasting methods, such as SARIMA and Prophet, to further improve anomaly detection techniques.
